# freeCodeCamp Random Quote Machine

This was a project I was tasked to build out to be similar to https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/qRZeGZ which was part of freeCodeCamps Front End Libraries Certificate.

I challenged myself to use `Bootstrap` and `React`. After figuring out `Bootstrap` I decided to use `React Context` for a global state.

## Todos:

- RandomQuote inside its own context
- Slow down the color transition
- Don't allow any variation of white for the background color. Or make it change the text color if the background does become white.
- Make the Double quotes a bigger icon.
- Hover effect for buttons
